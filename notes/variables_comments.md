## Variables and Comments

<br>

```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

/*
1st line
This is a multi line comment.
last line
*/

// Example comment 
int main(){
    int var1 = 7;
    float var2 = 7.0;
    cout << "Variables and Comments " << var1;
    cout << var2;
    return 0;
}
```

- Comments can placed using "//" before the sentences
- Multi line comments can be placed between "/*multi-line comment goes here */"
- Variables are data containers and their type has to be mentioned while declaring
- Variables types can be int, float, bool, char etc..
