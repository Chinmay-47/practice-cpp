### First Program

<br>

- C++ is extremely fast
- Adds OOP to C
- Allows for memory management

<br>

```c++
#include<iostream>

int main(){
    std :: cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

- Include statement is like an import
- iostream is a built in library providing IO capabilities
- std is the namespace that containts the cout function
- cout is like print
